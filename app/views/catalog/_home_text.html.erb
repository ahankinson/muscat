<h3 class="welcome">Search options</h3>

<p>
The simple search mode is the easiest way to start a search. Because the search is performed in all fields, the method produces often a long list of results. If you start your search from there, you will be able to refine your search by adding criteria directly in the result page.	
</p>

<p class="welcome-tip">A search with more than one word will give as result only the sources that match <strong>all</strong> the criteria. However, the words do not have to be in the same field.</p>

<p class="welcome-tip">Phrases, or expressions, can be given between quotes: for example <strong>"benedictus dominus"</strong>.</p>

<p class="welcome-tip">All the different options can be combined. For example <strong>"Ave Maria" CH-E</strong> matches all the sources of the Einsiedeln monastery library with <em>Ave Maria</em>.</p>

<p class="welcome-tip">For non ASCII characters, such as Cyrillic words, the search works as long as both versions (original and transliterated) were entered in the database. For example <strong>kalinka</strong> and <strong>калинка</strong> will return the same results.</p>
